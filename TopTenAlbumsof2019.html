Welcome to your favorite part of the year. People recollecting about 2019, making grand statements about &lsquo;the year&rsquo; that probably aren&rsquo;t true. I listened to a lot of music this year. So I made a list of my favorites. I could not bring myself to excluding just 10, so I threw down 15 fucking extra albums, just to show you how many albums I&rsquo;ve thought about. Be impressed. Thanks for reading, I enjoy doing this, just the allusion that I&rsquo;m writing to one of my friends is enough for me to do it, so thanks for keeping the allusion alive. I don&rsquo;t give a shit if you ever listen to any of these, you&rsquo;ll still be my friend. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, both our lives would be better if you did, but whatever.

Chromatics- Closer to Grey</span></p><p class="c1"><span>The Chromatics have always kept close associations to cinema with their music. They have a keen ability to establish and sustain a mood that transports you to another place of mystery and intrigue. But it has been seven years since their last full length record. In that time there has been a level of intrigue and mystery about their music that is as cinematic as the music itself. The much anticipated follow up to 2012&rsquo;s </span><span class="c2">Kill For Love</span><span>, an album named </span><span class="c2">Dear Tommy</span><span>&nbsp;was set to be released on Valentine&rsquo;s Day in 2016. After nearly drowning in Hawaii, the band&rsquo;s prolific producer, Johnny Jewel, physically destroyed somewhere around ten thousand copies of </span><span class="c2">Dear Tommy</span><span>. So, when Chromatics released an album in October of this year, it seemed like the finale of a dramatic saga. But the album was marked with the roman numerals VII and was not titled</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Dear Tommy</span><span>. Now it seems people are more interested in the missing album VI, </span><span class="c2">Dear Tommy</span><span>, then what was actually released, Album VII Closer to Grey. Unfortunately, the misdirection of this album&rsquo;s release has deterred it&rsquo;s deserved attention. Well, I&rsquo;m here to say, after being spun around a few times myself, I love this record. That cinematic quality that swirls around Chromatics hasn&rsquo;t left for this album. There&rsquo;s an essence of noir that is implicit with the bands work at this point, but this album assumes the genre&rsquo;s form only to play around with it in exciting ways. The classic noir staples remain in the three-song run of &lsquo;Light as a Feather&rsquo;, &lsquo;Move a Mountain&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Touch Red&rsquo;, a rain-soaked walk along a lamplit street into a drab office room. But songs like &lsquo;Closer to Grey&rsquo; and &lsquo;Twist the Knife&rsquo; have disco thumping heartbeats that bring the Chromatics&rsquo; to a part of the dancefloor they&rsquo;ve never been before. But there are also elements fit for an original soundtrack, &lsquo;Through the Looking Glass&rsquo; &lsquo;Love Theme From Closer to Grey&rsquo;. And of course, </span><span class="c2">Kill For Love</span><span class="c0">&rsquo;s unforgettable opening, a cover of Neil Young&rsquo;s &lsquo;Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)&rsquo; finds its spiritual sequel in a barren and hollow cover of Simon and Garfunkel&rsquo;s &lsquo;Sound of Silence&rsquo;. Thankfully, this album is an exciting manifestation, arisen out of years of mystery.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">9. I, I- Bon Iver</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Full disclosure; I spent a lot of time hemming and hawing over whether or not this would be worthy of being highlighted on a top ten list, especially considering the crowded field of albums I had to select from. Bon Iver is such a ubiquitous staple of indie music that it seems hackneyed to talk about them yet again. But after listening to this record one more time on high quality headphones, its undeniable how prolific and sublime the production of this record is. There&rsquo;s so much going on with the noises, textures, and melodies of this album that it takes four of five listens to really start to understand how everything is coming together. And amidst all of that, our hipster, indie-boy Lord and Savior Justin Vernon brings a familiarity with that unmistakable voice that holds everything together. My favorite moments are when the pieces are pulled so far apart that it feels like the songs has been ripped into disparate parts, (like in &lsquo;iMi&rsquo;, &lsquo;We&rsquo;, &lsquo;Naeem&rsquo;, &lsquo;Jelmore&rsquo;) but those moments only work so well because of their contrast with the more traditionally composed moments (like &lsquo;Hey Ma&rsquo;, &lsquo;U (Man Like)&rsquo;, &lsquo;Faith&rsquo;, &lsquo;Salem&rsquo;). The play between those two dynamics flips the record back and forth at the perfect times, like a beautiful fucking pancake&hellip;.right when those bubbles are starting to show, and the brown isn&rsquo;t too dark, but it&rsquo;s like a nice golden hue&hellip;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">8. Two Hands- Big Thief</span></p><p class="c1"><span>What a year for Big Thief. Their two albums, both of which have been widely acclaimed have cemented them as staples in the Indie Rock landscape. Their ability to realize and sustain such a unique voice is certainly key to their rise. Lead singer Adrianne Lenker&rsquo;s puerile vocals disarms the horror of the tales she is telling, making them palatable enough to be delivered to anyone without compromising the stories&rsquo; horrible truth for the sake of appeal. </span><span class="c2">Two Hands</span><span class="c0">, an album that Big Thief has labeled as their album for the stage, plays much softer than their previous effort. Many of the tracks work through personal torment with quietude and care, allowing histories of trauma to be disguised as lullabies. I could literally highlight every single track, but perhaps the linchpin of the record is the unbelievable &lsquo;Not&rsquo;, a six-minute exercise in centering prayer around absence. Lenker repeats the word &lsquo;not&rsquo; until its reduced to nothing. The word becomes a hub around which the rest of the song revolves until it explodes outward into a characteristically idiosyncratic guitar solo from Buck Meek, and then it unspools completely into mere noises and sounds. It&rsquo;s a much-needed emotional release, a louder cathartic moment on an unbelievably reserved effort, considering its emotional content. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">7. All Mirrors- Angel Olsen</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Angel Olsen has this enchanting smirk that she wears through much of her live performances and through many of her interviews. It&rsquo;s an all-knowing, self-assured smile that transmits her elegant poise. And no other album of Olsen&rsquo;s is more elegantly poised than </span><span class="c2">All Mirrors</span><span class="c0">. Lyrically throughout the record she dives inward while simultaneously bolstering her accompaniment with majestic compositions. The record is so perfectly put together it feels like the execution of something that&rsquo;s been practiced for years. As she works through internal revelations, the compositions arm her boldly, like that beautiful unique smirk.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">6. A Quiet Farwell, Twenty Sixteen to Twenty Eighteen- Slauson Malone</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Slauson Malone is the solo moniker of former Standing on the Corner member Jasper Marsalis. And like the hip-hop, jazz ensemble he hails from, Slauson Malone, contains a spirit of freedom that allows his work to never settle into one identifiable thing. Consisting of a collection of songs recorded from 2016-2018, </span><span class="c2">A Quiet Farwell </span><span class="c0">plays like a DJ on acid with an attention deficit disorder, sampling his favorite Jazz records and occasionally asking his friends to rap over the beats. Like DJ Shadow meets Flying Lotus meets J Dilla meets Earl Sweatshirt, Slauson Malone&rsquo;s approach is at once improvisational or melodic and at other times warped and dissonant and still at other times it has the kind of herky-jerky flow that a beat produced by Earl Sweatshirt might have (especially recently). But if you can surrender to letting the record take you where it goes, it can be an invigorating and joyfully surprising ride.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">5. ZUU- Denzel Curry</span></p><p class="c1"><span>About two years ago I was at a show that Denzel Curry was opening for. I didn&rsquo;t know much about him other than the meme hit &lsquo;Ultimate&rsquo;. The music for his first song began, he was nowhere to be seen, for about a minute, and then he came out literally sprinting and screaming at the top of his lungs. My jaw was on the floor throughout the first 5 minutes of his set. Then he covered Nirvanna&hellip; and the rest is history. </span><span class="c2">ZUU</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is the glittering, stunting announcement that this dude with unmatchable energy just put out perhaps the best hip-hop album of the year. Joining a rich history of rappers reppin&rsquo; their hometown, Curry soaks these tracks in the kind of swagger and flash that has long represented Miami. &lsquo;ZUU&rsquo;, &lsquo;BIRDZ&rsquo;, and &lsquo;P.A.T.&rsquo; are the ragers that can fill in the missing gaps in your workout playlist. I&rsquo;m convinced that &lsquo;CAROLMART&rsquo; and &lsquo;SHAKE 88&rsquo; are exactly what it feels like to go clubbing all night in Miami, and I&rsquo;ve never even been to Miami. &lsquo;Automatic&rsquo; and &lsquo;Speedboat&rsquo; are all-pro level Hip-Hop tracks. And of course, the shining moment of the record, one of the greatest hip-hop skits maybe of the decade, &lsquo;YOO&rsquo;. If you don&rsquo;t listen to the record, just listen to &lsquo;YOO&rsquo;, you won&rsquo;t regret it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">4. Agora- Fennesz</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Christian Fennesz is a guitarist and composer who&rsquo;s been around for a long time. For over two-decades he&rsquo;s been producing phenomenal compositions of electronic music that utilize his specializations to precise effect. And my goodness is </span><span class="c2">Agora</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;astonishing. I adore electronic music because it requires a different way of listening than almost any other genre. You need to be able to slow down and let go, in order to drink in great electronic pieces. This record, if you let it, will put you in a movie, make you think about your place in the fucking universe, or just let you look at the stars and be amazed. If you&rsquo;re a person who can just sit down in a quiet, empty room for 15 minutes without doing anything, you need this in your life. It&rsquo;s been such a fruitful platform for meditation for me and I don&rsquo;t even know how Fennesz does it. It&rsquo;s at once so sparse and layered and complex. I feel like I don&rsquo;t deserve to listen to it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">3. U.F.O.F.- Big Thief</span></p><p class="c1"><span>If </span><span class="c2">Two Hands</span><span>&nbsp;is histories of trauma disguised as fairytales, </span><span class="c2">U.F.O.F.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is a collection of cosmic mythologies with kernels of truth too profound to be delivered plainly. The earlier effort of the band&rsquo;s phenomenal year is more complex in composition and production which give the band an appropriate gravitas. The scream at the end of &lsquo;Contact&rsquo;, the sampled snippets in &lsquo;U.F.O.F.&rsquo; and the rolling ball or whatever the hell is happening at the beginning of &lsquo;From&rsquo;, are genius production touches that bring the record to an absurd level of sophisticated technique. &nbsp;&lsquo;Cattails&rsquo; is bursting with the distinct warmth of folk rock. &lsquo;Century&rsquo; has such a killer delivery, a cooing poem surrounded by perfectly dexterous guitar, it might be my favorite track. &lsquo;Strange&rsquo; is a pure and mysterious delight. Each song has a warmth and lushness like the foliage backdrop of the album, but also a coolness, like a serene gentile rain, drizzling over the entire experience. These are stories best told outside, by a fire pit, under the stars, or on the edge of the dock. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">2. House of Sugar- Alex G</span></p><p class="c1"><span>No other album received more plays from me this year than my boy Alex G&rsquo;s. I had so much uncontained enthusiasm for the entire rollout of this album that it&rsquo;s hard to process it as one piece, having spent so much time with the singles before the album was released. The word &lsquo;eccentric&rsquo; seems obligatory to any Alex G review at this point, but it gets at something essential about his dynamic. It&rsquo;s very clear through his discography that whatever is going on in and around Alex G comes out in a uniquely arranged way on each song and on each album. </span><span class="c2">House of Sugar</span><span>&nbsp;sharpens a skill that Alex (I&rsquo;m just gonna say Alex, like he&rsquo;s my friend) has displayed throughout his career and it&rsquo;s very similar to the way Adrianne Lenker uses her voice to disarm the darkness of her tales. Alex marries fairytale quality to darker content in a way that disarms the pain he sings about on this record; the addictions (Taking), death (Hope), and heartbreak (Walk Away). At times, the album is brooding and melancholic like in the gravity of the storytelling on &lsquo;Hope&rsquo; and &lsquo;Taking&rsquo;. At times it&rsquo;s bursting with warmth and love like the electro-folk infused &lsquo;Bad Man&rsquo; and the elegant tunes &lsquo;Southern Sky&rsquo; and &lsquo;Cow&rsquo;, a couple loose threads that lead back to the Americana that ran through much of his previous project </span><span class="c2">Rocket</span><span class="c0">. Each song always has that special Alex G-pixie dust that results from laying himself bare, authentically expressing what&rsquo;s stirring within the deepest parts of him, things that could only be expressed through music. Even &lsquo;Project 2&rsquo;, perhaps one of my favorite Alex G songs of all time (which is really saying something) doesn&rsquo;t even need words to convey that this is someone working out their feelings in the only way they know how, and maybe the only way they can. And then there&rsquo;s &lsquo;Gretel&rsquo;, something of an anthem or rallying cry for the characters that are often deeply hurting within Alex G&rsquo;s stories. It took this song for me to realize that part of the reason I connect so deeply with Alex G is because I&rsquo;m one of those characters, you&rsquo;re one of those characters, and maybe so is he.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">1. All My Heroes Are Cornballs- JPEGMafia</span></p><p class="c1"><span>I was at a JPEGMafia show this summer at a music festival and I loosely knew some of his songs off of 2018&rsquo;s </span><span class="c2">Veteran</span><span>. I understood them as good &lsquo;ole hip hop bangers, songs that a bunch of white boys would use to work out all of their angst. As I watched Peggy (I&rsquo;m gonna call him Peggy, like I&rsquo;m his friend) stroll onto the stage, plug his laptop in and simply press play on banger #1, I realized, I wasn&rsquo;t wrong, but I also realized that Peggy probably felt the same way. At one point he said, &ldquo;this next song is called &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t fucking waaaaaiiiittttt until Morissey dies&rsquo; the crowd erupted in applause to which he shook his head and mouthed &lsquo;nooo&rsquo; like we weren&rsquo;t picking up on the irony. </span><span class="c2">All My Heroes Are Cornballs</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is a deep dive into the entire dynamic of that experience. It is constantly plagued by its own self-awareness, Peggy can hardly utter a line without making fun of himself, or someone else. He leans so heavily into irony that it&rsquo;s hard to truly tell when he&rsquo;s being sincere or ironic. But within that confusion is a sincere truth being worked out, somewhere. There&rsquo;s a lot of introspection happening in between the shots fired at white boys like yours truly, at police, at other rappers, and at pretty much everyone. Within the moments where his gun is pointed at his own head, we see how multivalent his own identity is. On &lsquo;PTSD&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;&lsquo;Uh, I feel like Sami Zayn, my moves are makin&#39; waves. Tell the writers, &quot;Write in the title,&quot; huh. Two guns like Lara Croft. I look like Herman Cain. I dress like Jimmy John.&rdquo; And on BBW, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the young black Brian Wilson&rdquo;. Each of these identities may be true, but some of them are obviously made in jest, right? That&rsquo;s the trick he&rsquo;s preforming. It is truly hilarious to say &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the young black Brian Wilson&rdquo;, but damn, it might be true. Especially considering the production of the record. The production has a real signature, one stamped with Peggy&rsquo;s post-irony (there&rsquo;s a song titled, &lsquo;JPEGMAFIA TYPE BEAT&rsquo;). It has the attention span somewhere between that of a fruit fly and myself (I don&rsquo;t have a very long attention span). It is a flow that is difficult to sink into, but it&rsquo;s clear that Peggy doesn&rsquo;t give a shit whether or not you&rsquo;re along for the ride. It drifts into moments that are reminiscent of that cursed banger reputation (the middle of &lsquo;Kenan vs Kel&rsquo;, the beginning of &lsquo;Post Verified Lifestyle&rsquo;, &rsquo;PRONE!&rsquo;), but just as those engines rev, they subside into complex layered beats. Virtually the entire second Act of the album is packed with delicious beat after delicious beat; &lsquo;Thot Tactics&rsquo;, &lsquo;Free the Frail&rsquo;, &lsquo;Post Verified Lifestyle&rsquo;, &lsquo;Dots Freestyle Remix&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Buttermilk Jesus Type Beat&rsquo; are all worth mention. Oh and the record is genuinely hilarious. An important ingredient in any irony is humor, and there&rsquo;s a vital vein of humor pumping through the entire record, (&lsquo;we&rsquo;re playing with pencils for fun?&rsquo;, &lsquo;this a weed song&rsquo;, &lsquo;the meal is gon&rsquo; be large&rsquo;). And the concluding track, &lsquo;Papi I Missed U&rsquo; is the sincere landing that the album has to have. It signals to each of us, that there is deep, sincere truth and feelings being worked out ; maybe it&rsquo;s laying within the funny quips, maybe it&rsquo;s within the screams, maybe it&rsquo;s within the electronic R&amp;B warbles, but maybe it&rsquo;s not. I don&rsquo;t know.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">AAAAAAAHHHHHHHH AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Happy New Year</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p></body></html>
